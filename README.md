todo

- continue debugging the broken booking logic (unable to find the time from and time to)
- actually implement the booking logic (via dragging/dropping the room bookings) and automate that for myself to book fbs rooms during this exam period
- have that displayed on the frontend
- ensure everything looks clean on desktop and mobile
- furnish the README.md
- add a button to the navbar to automatically star the project on Github if they like it
